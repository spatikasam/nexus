# NEXUS

NEXUS is an interactive web experience that explores the concept of emotionally charged everyday objects. The data collected for this project include images of objects, each paired with an emotion label. This dataset is then visualised as a 2D map, where each image is a point in space.

A classical machine learning method, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is applied to the dataset for dimensionality reduction. Visual features such as RGB mean, RGB standard deviation, brightness mean, and saturation mean are analysed to arrange the images by visual similarity across the 2D plane. This means that images that look similar in colour and brightness will fall closer together in the constellation of everyday objects. Each object image has a respective colour for the emotion it evokes, according to the user's upload. Users can observe patterns in how visual similarity and emotions merge and vary across the 2D space.

The work highlights tension between what machines can see and what humans can feel. The 2D map is like a landscape to wander and explore how emotion aligns or resists the structure imposed by the algorithm.
